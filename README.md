# 🛒 Sell Cart (WIP)

Sell Cart is a full-stack e-commerce web application currently under development.  
It is designed for **individual buyers and sellers** to list, browse, and purchase products — whether new or used.  
Unlike large corporate marketplaces, Sell Cart focuses on **peer-to-peer commerce**, making it simple for anyone to buy or sell with ease.
